HW2 for CS294-84
This is a record for a mini T9 keyboard. I used buttons, the breadboard, and bundle wires to make the model because I couldn't schedule a time for the electronic lab training and get a maker pass. But the keyboard is working, and you can type "hello word" on it. I'll try to improve it after I get access to the lab!
